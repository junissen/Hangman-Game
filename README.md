Hangman game for HW3 UMN Bootcamp

The Hangman Game is a website that allows users to press any letter key to solve which 80s movie is listed. If the user does not type a letter or types a letter that has already been chosen, an alert message is shown. The user is allowed 10 guesses per movie title. If the word is not guessed within 10 guesses, an alert message displays that the user has lost the game and prompts them if they would like to play again. The game keeps track of wins, and upon replaying the user returns to a win count of 0. 

If the word is guessed within 10 guesses, the user gains a win and the movie poster is shown and a song from the movie plays. The user has the option to mute or unmute the song using the buttons on the page.
